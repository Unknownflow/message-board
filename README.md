# Mini Message Board

The main goal of this project was to design a message where the user can add new messages to the message board. It exposed me to the use of backend technologies with ExpressJS and I learnt more about the routing of webpages. The <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-mini-message-board">project</a> is part of The Odin Project.
